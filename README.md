# nhop-pco-sim
Multi-hop Pulse-Coupled Oscillators Simulation

## requirements

- create a simulation tracking the number of epochs required for synchronization
- and once synchronized, the number of epochs required to stay synchronized
- the number of messages required 
- how long each epoch takes

- different network configurations
- different failure scenarios
- different dynamic network configurations

- comparing standard leader-based synchronization
- with PCO (multi-hop)
- and PCO + message suppression
- and PCO + MS + SPR/LPR

# plan:

- start with a simple PCO simulation
  -
